We've got to stop every once in a while and celebrate one another and our team victories, no matter how small. Yes, there's more work to be done, and things could go sideways in an hour, but that will never take away from the fact that we need to celebrate an accomplishment right now.

If you are creative, you will find millions of things to celebrate that are aligned with your business’ mindset. Celebrating helps everyone in the team feel the value they have brought to this world. It unites and increases ownership.

Often people think that celebrating means going out together or having some kind of team event; however, it can be many other things too. It can be a ‘thank you’ or praise at the end of a retrospective. It can be dedicated time to think of the achievements or laugh at the failures. 

So once you have mastered all of the elements of #superagile, **never forget this last one - celebrate**!
