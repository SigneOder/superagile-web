# Psychological safety

We all know that keeping the team effective and productive is something difficult to create and easy to lose. Similar to building trust goes the atmospheric sense of psychological safety. Maybe you have heard of Google’s study on effective teams. Psychological safety was the first and most important thing: we couldn't agree more.

If we feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of our team, we can learn from our failures, overcome obstacles and challenges, and be creative in finding innovative solutions. Innovation, however, is needed for business growth (another element of #superagile). And so is constant learning.

In the realm of technology, there's a constant stream of new frameworks and tools being introduced. Remaining loyal to a particular tool simply out of habit could result in the loss of both time and money.

Robert Kiyosaki has said: “In today’s fast-changing world, it’s not so much what you know anymore that counts, because often what you know is old. It is how fast you learn. That skill is priceless.” But for learning, we need a safe environment.

Questions to ask:

- Do I feel comfortable enough that I can ask when there is something I don’t understand?
- Can I express my thoughts even when they diverge from the opinions of others?
