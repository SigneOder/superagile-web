# Continuous deployment

Continuous deployment (CDP) is a software release process where changes are automatically deployed to the production environment without human interaction. It relies solely on automated testing and an automated release pipeline.

Releasing as often as possible encourages you to validate the smaller changes to your users which allows you to adapt quickly. With more experiments like these, your innovation and business will grow exponentially while learning quicker than competitors.

Every line of code written by a developer only starts to bring value once it finally reaches the end-users.

The smaller the increments of change, the less risk of breaking things. Which in turn, means faster recovery from failure.

**KPIs to measure:**

- How many deployments do you do each day (per developer)?
- How long does it take from code push to reach production?
