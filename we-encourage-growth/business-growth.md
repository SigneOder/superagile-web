# Business growth

*Imagine embarking on a journey as a driver, placing all your trust in a GPS system without entering a specific destination. As you drive, the GPS might provide turns, stops, and reroutes, but without a clear end point, you'd find yourself driving aimlessly. You wouldn’t know if you've reached a significant location, if you're merely taking a detour, or if you're just circling back to where you started. You wouldn’t be able to work around roadblocks or traffic jams that come up.*

Developers' understanding of the broader vision behind their tasks can radically shift their approach to their work.

When developers understand the goal behind their work, it transforms the way they approach tasks. Knowing the 'why' behind the 'what' gives them a clearer direction, leading to better decision-making and more relevant solutions. Instead of just following instructions, they become proactive problem solvers. This alignment with the objective not only improves the quality and relevance of their output but also fosters a sense of ownership and connection to the broader vision of the project.

The clarity of purpose has a ripple effect throughout the team's operations. When developers understand the 'why', they can better evaluate the 'how'. This doesn't mean they're only finding the most efficient ways to code but they're also seeking the most effective solutions to achieve the objective. They start to ask pivotal questions like, "Is there a better way to do this that we haven't considered?" or "Does this feature genuinely serve our end goal?" Such introspective inquiries help avoid wasted efforts and ensure resources are channeled optimally.

Furthermore, the freedom to experiment is an invaluable asset. Traditional development models can sometimes handcuff developers to specific paths, but when the focus is the objective, there's room to explore. Experimentation leads to innovation. It means teams can test out different approaches, determine what works best, and pivot when necessary.

This agile mindset ensures that even if an initial hypothesis is off-mark, the team can learn, adapt, and refocus quickly. The direct business benefit here is reduced time-to-market. When teams can rapidly iterate and pivot based on feedback, products and features are released faster, granting the company a competitive edge. Furthermore, this agility often results in a better product-market fit, leading to enhanced customer loyalty and brand differentiation in the marketplace.

In conclusion, when developers are intricately aligned with the business vision, the company stands to gain immensely. Not only do they produce more relevant and innovative solutions, but they also help position the business favorably in a competitive landscape.

**KPIs to measure:**

- How many of the built functionalities have a measurable hypothesis set before it is developed?
- How many of the features that turned out to be not-so-successful could have been prevented with better cooperation and idea validation beforehand?
