# Customer feedback

*Imagine an inventor trapped in an isolated chamber, with only a small window to send out his creations to the outside world. Once the invention passes through, the window shuts, offering no glimpse of the world beyond or any indication of how his invention is received. This brilliant mind, although teeming with ideas, operates in a vacuum, with no feedback loop, forever in the dark about the true needs and reactions of the world outside.*

This narrative, software being deployed without understanding how it's used, is a familiar tragedy in today's business environments. Brilliant teams can churn out innovative products, but without insight from the world outside, these products often fall flat.

It's tempting to believe that developers, sitting in their home offices, should only concern themselves with code, leaving user needs to product managers or UX designers. This mindset is a pitfall. Developers, being at the heart of creation, must be exposed to the consequences of their creations â€“ both the good and the bad.

A developer aware of user feedback is better equipped to make decisions that benefit the end-user. When they understand what users appreciate or struggle with, they can proactively address those aspects in their approach. Developers armed with real-time feedback can quickly iterate on their solutions, reducing the time between product releases and improvements.
